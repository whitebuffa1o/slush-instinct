    <p>Welcome to the static markup. This exists to make it less painful to develop a new project. No one likes going back and forth through a clunky web interface. Just code out your files here instead.</p>

    <p>You can use:</p>

    <ul>
      {{#file.data.features}}
        <li>{{.}}</li>
      {{/file.data.features}}
    </ul>

    <p>Hooray! This page serves as a quick example of how to do the basics with the above mentioned.</p>
