 * Color Maps

 * Tips:
 * - Try to avoid naming them after the actual color they are being set to.
 * - Don't throw every variation in here, it gets confusing fast. Utilize
 *   sass's built in lighten(), darken(), hsl(), etc functions to get
 *   different variations of the same color.
 * - Similarly, use lighten(white) and darken(black) to get different shades
 *   of grey throughout the project.
